	<h1><em>CZ</em>Raven</h1>
	<h2>hello and welcome to my website*</h2>
	<p>I am <a href="https://github.com/CZRaven" title="CZRaven github">CZRaven</a>, some skid from indonesia, though i travel alot. Please don't expect me to understand anything you say, because i have no idea what i am doing or what i am talking about. I have done a very small amount of coding, but it is <strong>very shit</strong>.
	<br> 
	<strong>*I have made this completely by myself, and i don't have much knowledge on making websites, so it is quite bad. you can find all the code on my <a href="https://github.com/CZRaven/CZRaven.github.io" title="github repo">github repo</a>, and the site is hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com" title="Github pages website">github pages</a>. hopefully in the future it can be better.</strong>
